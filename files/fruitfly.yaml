  Does access to mating affect the lifespan of fruitflies? This data shows the
  longevity of male fruitflies in the presence or absence of female fruitflies
  to mate with. Male fruitflies were housed with 0, 1, or 8 females. In some
  groups, the females were pregnant and thus not available for mating. There are
  two covariates, length of the thorax and percentage of time sleeping, that
  might also influence longevity.
