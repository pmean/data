  This data set shows an experiment where ten subjects with osteoarthritis were
  evaluated after transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), short wave
  diathermy (SWD), and after no treatment. There is no information on whether the
  order of the three treatments was randomized. It seems reasonable to assume 
  that the affect of the three treatments was short term with no carry-over 
  effects. Researchers measured pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and range of
  motion (ROM).
