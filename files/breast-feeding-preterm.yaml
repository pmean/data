description: >
  This data comes from a research study
  done at Children's Mercy Hospital and
  St. Luke's Medical Center. This was a
  study of breast feeding in pre-term
  infants. Infants were randomized into
  either a treatment group (NG tube) or
  a control group (Bottle). Infants in
  the NG tube group were fed in the 
  hospital via their nasogastral tube 
  when the mother was not available 
  for breast feeding. Infants in the 
  bottle group received bottles when 
  the mothers were not available. Both
  groups were monitored for six months
  after discharge from the hospital.
