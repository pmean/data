description: >
  This data set is from a cluster randomized trial in Norway. Students from 57
  schools were recruited for the study. 29 schools were randomly assigned to
  physical activity intervention and 28 schools served as a control group. 
  The outcomes were changes in various measures of cardiometabolic health.
