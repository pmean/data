## datasets

This repository stores various datasets that I use in my talks and my classes. It does not include any datasets that I use in my private consulting practice. Those datasets are assumed to be owned by the client and would only be stored in a private repository.

I will eventually consolidate all the datasets that I have stored in various other repositories here. Some of the repositories that I need to move data from include

-   [classes][cla]
-   [data-dictonaries][dat]
-   [introduction-to-r][inr]
-   [introduction-to-sas][isa]
-   [introduction-to-sql][isq]

For many of the datasets in this repository, the copyright is not clearly stated anywhere that I could find. Use by individuals for educational purposes is probably acceptable under the Fair Use provisions of copyright law.

If you own the copyright to any of these datasets and wish to clarify the conditions under which they can be used, please contact me (mail@pmean.com). If I am not allowed to store your data on my repository, I would be glad to remove your dataset.

Here are the datasets in this repository so far:
 
-   **absorbent-paper** : Foot progression angle (FPA) is typically measured using an expensive pressure platform, but this dataset examines a simpler approach using water, absorbent  paper, and a goniometer. Thirteen  children were assessed both on the  left foot and the right foot. This was  repeated two weeks later. In this study, all the assessments were negative,  representing in-toeing gait.

    -   -   **airline-bumping** : This dataset shows the number of times passengers were "bumped" from an airline flight. Bumping occurs when an airline overbooks reservations for a flight. Normally, the airline will ask for volunteers who will agree to take a later flight in exchange for cash or travel vouchers. But if no one volunteers, airlines will involuntarily bump passengers from the flight.
