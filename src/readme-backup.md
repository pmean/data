## datasets

This repository stores various datasets that I use in my talks and my classes. It does not include any datasets that I use in my private consulting practice. Those datasets are assumed to be owned by the client and would only be stored in a private repository.

I will eventually consolidate all the datasets that I have stored in various other repositories here. Some of the repositories that I need to move data from include

-   [classes](https://github.com/pmean/classes)
-   [data-dictonaries](https://github.com/pmean/data-dictionaries)
-   [introduction-to-r](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-r)
-   [introduction-to-sas](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sas)
-   [introduction-to-sql](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sql)
-   [survival-models](https://github.com/pmean/survival-models)

For many of the datasets in this repository, the copyright is not clearly stated anywhere that I could find. Use by individuals for educational purposes is probably acceptable under the Fair Use provisions of copyright law.

If you own the copyright to any of these datasets and wish to clarify the conditions under which they can be used, please contact me ([mail\@pmean.com](mailto:mail@pmean.com){.email}). If I am not allowed to store your data on my repository, I would be glad to remove your dataset.

Here are the datasets in this repository so far:
 
-   **absorbent-paper** : Foot progression angle (FPA) is typically measured using an expensive pressure platform, but this dataset examines a simpler approach using water, absorbent  paper, and a goniometer. Thirteen  children were assessed both on the  left foot and the right foot. This was  repeated two weeks later. In this study, all the assessments were negative,  representing in-toeing gait.

-   [aids-cases.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmean/data/main/files/aids-cases.csv)
-   **airline-bumping** : This dataset shows the number of times passengers were "bumped" from an airline flight. Bumping occurs when an airline overbooks reservations for a flight. Normally, the airline will ask for volunteers who will agree to take a later flight in exchange for cash or travel vouchers. But if no one volunteers, airlines will involuntarily bump passengers from the flight.

This type of data is collected by multiple  listing agencies in many cities and is used by  realtors as an information base.

This paper found 11 studies that examined whether the risk of malpresentation (e.g., breech births) was higher in ART pregnancies compared to natural conception (NC).

-   **breast-feeding-preterm** : This data comes from a research study done at Children's Mercy Hospital and St. Luke's Medical Center. This was a study of breast feeding in  pre-term infants. Infants were randomized into either a treatment group (NG tube) or a control group (Bottle). Infants in the NG tube group  were fed in the hospital via their nasogastral tube when the mother was not available for breast feeding. Infants in the bottle group received bottles when the mothers were not available. Both groups were monitored for six months after discharge from the hospital.

Ultarsonagraphy was used to identify carotid plaque and/or cerebrovascular disease. The imaging produced measures of Von Mises strain. The key measure is peak, which appears to be an average or a maximum over four or five cycles. There are separate measurements at systole and diastole.
